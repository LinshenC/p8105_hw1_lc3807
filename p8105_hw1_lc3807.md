This dataset show some important information about Newark airpot. The
dataset have 358 rows and 15 colums. The variables in dataset include
origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed,
wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, time_hour. The mean temperature in
given period is 39.5821229 F.

``` r

According to plot, the general trend in temperature is increasing in
given time period.

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(la_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or

    ## [1] NA

When taking mean of each variable, only numeric and logical vector which
are norm_samp and vec_logical work. Vector vec_char and vec_factor
doesn’t work since they are character and factor vector.

``` r
# Convert variables from one type to numeric

vec_logical = as.numeric(pull(la_df,vec_logical))
is.numeric(vec_logical)
vec_char = as.numeric(pull(la_df,vec_char))
is.numeric(vec_char)
vec_factor = as.numeric(pull(la_df,vec_factor))
is.numeric(vec_factor)
```

Using the function as.numeric on a logical vector (LogicalVector), FALSE
is converted to 0 and TRUE to 1. This illustrates how logical values are
represented numerically in R.

CharacterVector_numeric: Attempts to convert characters to numeric
values by applying as.numeric to a character vector (CharacterVector).
However, as characters cannot be turned into numbers directly, it yields
NA for each character.

FactorVector_numeric: When a factor vector (FactorVector) is applied
as.numeric, the factor levels are converted to their underlying integer
indices. Depending on the situation, this could not have a valid
interpretation for computations like mean.

The arithmetic mean is calculated as predicted by the mean of numeric
variables (such as LogicalVector_numeric). Since characters cannot be
meaningfully averaged, attempts to get the mean of a character vector,
such as CharacterVector_numeric, return NA. The numeric form of factor
levels (integer indices) is used to calculate the mean of a factor
vector, such as FactorVector_numeric, which may not always be useful.
